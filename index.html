          <h2>Walking with Apple Music</h2>
            <p>The data collected consists of song names, plays and skips, time,
            and level of satisfaction of songs I listened to over the span of
            a week.  The data visualization shows the paths taken to and from
            class, the level of satisfaction, my mood, and the approximate
            location the song was listened to based on timestamps.</p>

          <h2>Data Brokerage</h2>
            <p>Data brokerage is an ongoing practice that is defined as the
            collection of data and sold to organizations.  In the accompanying
            video, this concept is further explained along with examples
            and current legislation on the practice.  Just you can imagine how
            much data is collected day to day, Apple Music keeps track of songs
            listened to, which ones are liked, and which ones are skipped.
            They use this data to then serve you songs of the like and create
            a better listening experience.</p>

          <h2>Website Design</h2>
            <p>Throughout the semester I learned the complex nature of HTML and
            CSS Grid.  From <strong>inline elements</strong> and block
            elements to the design of stylesheets.  I took these lessons and
            used them to create this website to tell my datastory.  Through the
            use of div's, headers, classes, and css it has allowed me to create
            a responsive website for various platforms.  The design began with
            a mobile design and then on to a typical website design.</p>
